    Class 88: Exercise 18

    A survey was conducted among residents of a region collecting age, sex (M/F),
    and salary for X people (X is provided by the user). Write a program that reports:
      a) the average salary of the group;
      b) the highest and the lowest age in the group;
      c) the number of women whose salary is at most R$2000.00.
